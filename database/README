You need to install the postgis extension

e.g. to create backbone_test

sudo -u postgres psql
CREATE database backbone_test
alter schema public owner to iwright;
\c backbone_test
create extension postgis;

psql backbone_test
\i backbone_service.psql

Once it's created you can use:
rebuild.sh test

to empty the database
(note it will use the same existing structure NOT rebuild according to backbone_service.psql)
