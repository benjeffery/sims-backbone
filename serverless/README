The deployment requires multiple cloud formation stacks (limits) and therefore uses cross stack
references.

To deploy

In the following order change to the directory and run:

For dev version:

  sls deploy -v

For production:

  serverless deploy --stage production

Order of deployment:

  - sims-backbone-service
  - event-set-service

To see information about the deployed services

  sls info -v

To see the exported values:

  aws cloudformation list-exports


Bastion Host - for accessing the database directly

Postgres clients

pgAdmin IV is a web interface that's deployed as a docker instance but it's not especially good
(III doesn't support psql 10)

https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Community_Guide_to_PostgreSQL_GUI_Tools

Postico for Os X

Command to connect is:

  psql -h ##hostname## backbone_service bbs_admin

The hostname is from ```aws cloudformation list-exports``` - sims-backbone-service:DbHost-###stage###
The password is from config.##stage##.json

Client deployment

Get the API location values from ```sls info -v``` using the ServiceEndpoint value and update 

../client/sims-backbone/src/environments/environment.prod.ts

(Don't forget sims-backbone-service/v1 at the end)

Look at the README.md in ../client/sims-backbone for deploying the webapp to S3
