Note that this doesn't work but took a while to figure out so is recorded here for posterity as
there are some bits that might be useful elsewhere

Why doesn't it work

Mostly DMS does not support the postgres data types e.g. uuid

indexes are not migrated

constraints are not migrated

Possibly other things as well but that's enough!

You can't just run through the script as you need to wait for the replication to start up
